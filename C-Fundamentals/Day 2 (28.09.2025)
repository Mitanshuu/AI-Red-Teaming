DAY 2 - If Else Statements
Date:- 28.09.2025

**What I learned**
- If and else statements are conditional statements which are used to check if any condition is true or false and according to the condition the statements inside the if or else statements are executed. These can be used, as per my knowledge, for checking if the username entered is correct, if it is then proceed to show whatever the information is of that user inside the if statement.
